DONE: import Chernarus+ map and see if I can get the basics running
--Turns out this isn't easy to do.  Grabbed a building replacer script instead that adds Altis structures... Not sure if I like it yet, will have to see.
May want to get X-Cam up and running instead as well, see if I like that.  Not sure if there are enterable assets I can replace with.--
DONE: Evaluate other maps as possible better starting points -- nothing is quite right

DONE: Evaluate ACE and Advanced Movement to see how they feel --Keep Movement for now, leave out ACE, not sure what it would add at this point other than more script confusion while I'm building

DONE: Evaluate either X-Cam to update map for enterable building or do selective destruction of non-entrable buildings to create more of an open env  -- XCam might work for me but it'll be a lot of work.  For now the script alternative makes sense, we can roll from there till more is developed

DONE: Evaluate DAC for AI system -- DAC looks pretty interesting.  Not sure how it plays in a server world exactly but could be a quick route to the zones of control for the teams

Done: cut spawn item lists way down to get a simple feeling  -- Initial pass complete
